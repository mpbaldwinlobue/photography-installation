    "statement": "Photography, at its most basic level, is the capture of light within a space.\n\nYet contemporary image-making complicates this seemingly simple definition. Processes now exist that simulate, reconstruct, or generate images without traditional photographic methods.\n\nIn this installation, you are the curator.\n\nYou will be shown a series of works. Each is preceded by text — sometimes a question, sometimes a statement — that frames the work in a particular way.\n\nYour task is to decide whether each work belongs in your exhibition.\n\nYour decisions will determine the shape of the installation you create."
